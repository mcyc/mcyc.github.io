In collaboration with non-profit organizations, I’ve developed predictive models and interactive
dashboards to support **national campaign strategy** and **local outreach optimization**.
This project spans multiple phases and use cases across voter engagement analytics.

Below are selected highlights from this ongoing initiative.

### Selected Projects

- **Segmentation via Clustering**  

  Applied unsupervised learning (HDBSCAN) to identify voter segments with varying degrees of **partisanship and persuadability**.
  These insights inform message tailoring and targeting strategies. (To learn more, see [Clustering Analysis](/posts/voter-behaviour-clustering))

- **Geospatial Prioritization**

  Built models to rank neighbourhoods based on their **outreach responsiveness** using demographic, 
  behavioral, and electoral data. Deployed insights via a stakeholder-facing dashboard for field teams
  and campaign strategists. (See the [Impact Voters Dashboard](https://impact-voters.streamlit.app/) for a live example)
